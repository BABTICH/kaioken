/**
 * Entry guard shared by the gpu-first factories.
 *
 * Every free function starts the same way: resolve the private kernel of the `Gpu` it was handed
 * and refuse to build anything on a disposed one — after `gpu.dispose()` the device and every
 * resource it owned are gone, so a factory would hand back a handle that can only fail later,
 * usually inside a driver call with no useful stack.
 *
 * It lives in its own module (instead of `kernel.ts`) so the kernel keeps zero knowledge of the
 * feature families, and so the guard costs one tiny function in any bundle that uses a factory.
