/**
 * A chat turn, watched while it happens.
 *
 * Two things used to be wrong with the wait. The reply arrived in one piece
 * when the model finished — so an agentic turn showed a single word, "thinking",
 * for the whole of it, and the same wall-clock turn read as a hang next to
 * every other agent's token feed. And the reply only arrived after the
 * verification gate, which on a turn that wrote a file is the repository's own
 * typecheck, build and test — minutes of silence stacked on silence. Both are
 * properties of the wait, so both are tested while the turn is still in
 * flight, not after it settles.
