/**
 * The shell.
 *
 * One conversational surface, as in v1: a sticky wordmark-and-status header,
 * a scrolling transcript that everything writes into, the completion palette,
 * the composer, and one status row. There are no separate views — `/status`,
 * `/cards`, a chat reply and a proposed diff all land as styled lines in the
 * same scrollback, which is most of what makes the interface feel the way it
 * does.
 *
 * Key decisions, stated:
 * - The transcript is a `string[]`. Every builder that appends to it is a pure
 *   function in `transcript.ts`, so what the interface says is testable
 *   without a terminal.
 * - Rendering is pi-tui's: differential repaint, display-width arithmetic, the
 *   editor and the markdown parser. This file owns the state machine and the
 *   key grammar, nothing else.
 * - Commands do not run here. `dispatch` decides what a command means and
 *   returns a description of it; the shell is the only thing that touches the
 *   terminal or the engine.

	 * calls as they start, and the formatted reply replaces the raw stream the
	 * moment the model finishes — before the verification gate, whose verdict
	 * lands afterwards as the follow-up line it is. A turn where every one of
	 * those steps is visible reads as fast as it actually is; a turn that
	 * shows one word for the lot reads as a hang.
	 *
	 * `mode` decides whether the agent gets write tools at all: build and
	 * general do, plan/explore/review/prism do not — matching what `/mode`'s
	 * own help text promises. When it does, every write/edit/command goes
	 * through this shell's own approval prompt, the same one engine-command
	 * diffs use, so `/yolo` and a denied change behave identically here.
