/**
 * Hand a repository's knowledge to something outside this machine.
 *
 * The consumer is the design constraint: another agent, a teammate, a pipeline
 * with nothing installed. So the bundle is plain files — cards as JSON, wiki
 * chapters as the Markdown a person reads, skills beside them, and the graph
 * (as JSON, and rendered as prose) tying the whole together. No kaioken, no
 * node_modules, no credentials on the receiving side.
 *
 * The graph is derived here rather than read from `.kaioken/graph.json`: an
 * export that refused to run until someone remembered `kaioken graph` would be
 * a checkpoint in the way, and one that trusted a stale cache would ship a
 * bundle that contradicts itself.
