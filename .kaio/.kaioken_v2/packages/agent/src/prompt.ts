 * The system prompt is where this engine's advantage is spent or wasted.
 *
 * A generic coding agent guesses about the repository and then writes confident
 * prose about its guesses. This one is told, up front, three things it cannot
 * derive: what the repository is made of, what written procedure already exists
 * for working in it, and exactly which commands will be run against its claim of
 * success. The rest of the prompt exists to make it prefer asking the index over
 * remembering.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* here: the skills themselves, and the wiki. Both are
 * a tool call away. Inlining them would spend the context window on material for
 * tasks this session is not doing.
