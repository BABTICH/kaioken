/**
 * The /desktop wordmark, from website/DESKTOP APP-logo.html.
 *
 * The source art sets DESKTOP and APP side by side, 97 columns wide — which on
 * a phone means 6px type. Stacked, the widest block is 64 columns, so the same
 * logo reads at 9px in a 375px viewport. One string rather than two so the
 * red→orange sweep runs across both blocks instead of restarting.
 *
 * The D's top row starts at column 0: the two spaces in front of it in the
 * source file are that file's own HTML indentation, not part of the letter.
 * The A's single leading space is real — that is the ANSI Shadow letterform.
